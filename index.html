							<h3>EMDR is not hypnosis.</h3>
							<p>EMDR takes part of the subject back to revisit a traumatic past event in order to "reprocess" the experience and their emotions while keeping another part of the subject in the present through lateral eye movements.</p>

							<h3>How Does it work?</h3>
							<p>After a traumatic experience, the moment of the event gets "stuck in time." Revisiting the event can sometimes be just as painful as the event itself. EDMR sessions last 60-90 minutes and seem to have a direct effect on the way the brain processes information, behaving simularily to natural processes such as dreaming and REM eye movement.</p>

							<p>Eye Movement Therapy</p>
						</header>
						<p>EMDR is centered around the theory that lateral eye movements can relieve stress — and when these movements are controlled, patients are better equipped to tackle traumatic memories. The multi-phase EMDR process begins with patients identifying difficult memories related to their trauma. Once these memories have been targeted, therapists work to first desensitize patients to them, and then retrain the brain to process these memories in a more positive way — all while controlling lateral eye movements through hand motions, sounds and other stimuli.</p>

							<p>Theory</p>
						</header>
						<p>As this happens, for reasons believed by a Harvard researcher to be connected with the biological mechanisms involved in Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, internal associations arise and the clients begin to process the memory and disturbing feelings. In successful EMDR therapy, the meaning of painful events is transformed on an emotional level.  For instance, a victim shifts from feeling horror and repulsion to holding the firm belief that, “I survived it and I am strong.”  Unlike talk therapy, the insights clients gain in EMDR therapy result not so much from clinician interpretation, but from the client’s own accelerated intellectual and emotional processes.  The net effect is that clients conclude EMDR therapy feeling empowered by the very experiences that once debased them.  Their wounds have not just closed, they have transformed. As a natural outcome of the EMDR therapeutic process, the clients’ thoughts, feelings and behavior are all robust indicators of emotional health and resolution—all without speaking in detail or doing homework used in other therapies.
